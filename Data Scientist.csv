You will have a chance to work on and contribute to a state-of-the-art AI business assistant for executives to fight information overload and help them make the most optimum decisions.
Enki provides personalized, actionable, and instant market analysis without an analyst with spreadsheet. Our vision is to automate what analysts traditionally do using AI and NLP. Several VC firms and sales execs have already signed on for pilots. Now, we are looking for a full-stack developer to join our team and take the application to the next level.
You will have full ownership over the projects you work on and have a huge impact on the architecture and execution of the company. You will be working very closely with Chief Hustler and Chief Hacker. We may even assign you interns to build you as a future technology leader.

Qualifications
Experience with a general-purpose programming languages: Java, C/C++, C#, Python, or JavaScript
Degree in Computer Science, or similar field, or equivalent practical experience
Experience working with two of: web application development, distributed and parallel systems, machine learning, information retrieval, natural language processing, or developing large software systems.
Interest and ability to learn other coding languages as needed.
Ability to speak and write English fluently.

Familiarity with web crawling, natural language processing, and machine learning is a plus.

About us:
 Enki is a hot startup based in San Francisco, the core of Silicon Valley. 
   Enki 
helps B2B enterprise sales reps who work at smaller companies selling to large enterprise accounts valued at more than $100,000+/transaction
who wants to shorten the B2B sales cycle in half and increase revenue growth
by delivering 2x sales intelligence, shortening the research time by 10x and reducing non-selling activities by 50%, making the salesperson 5x more effective
unlike hiring an expensive research team, or spending time Googling the prospects yourself.

Enki’s proprietary NLP algorithms analyze internal (market research reports, notes, etc.) and external resources (web, news, earning call releases, Twitter, etc.) to bring market insights in front of the decision-makers. It acts like a personal assistant.
Sales Executives and VCs are the first set of users. Enki replaces the manual process of reading various news feeds, earning call releases, 10Ks, transcripts, research reports, and bring personalized insights in front of decision-makers in a matter of minutes.

Little about Chief Hacker:

My entrepreneurial journey started in the startup hubs of Seattle, where I happily spent my weekends hacking away on creative ideas and building high-quality prototypes. After winning hackathons in varying disciplines from AI to Voice to Blockchain, I’ve come to realize my gift to leverage the latest tech to solve challenges no one else can. These experiences kicked off my passion to innovate new products and build startups.

I began my career while I was in college, interning at multiple startups and fortune 500 companies. In my internships, I was fortunate to wear many hats: an engineer, a designer, a consultant, and a business specialist. After college, I was invited to be an engineer at Microsoft, where I was a part of the Windows, and Azure teams. I developed world-class experiences in software design and implementation, building scalable SaaS applications that served Microsoft's biggest customers around the world.

Little about Chief Hustler:

Nothing inspires me quite like challenging the status quo through technology-driven innovation. This passion drives me to build my startup, invest in new companies as an angel investor and become a mentor to help my peers.
 I have always pushed the envelope in my entire career. I was one of the youngest managers in a Fortune 500 Oil and Gas company, had no marketing experience and ran marketing teams, had zero sales experience and made 7 figure sales within a year. I believe in constant learning, teamwork, and challenging the status quo. I enjoy stepping out of my comfort zone.
 I met my co-founder, Chief Hacker at one of the data science hackathons about two years ago. Since then, we did many different projects and won multiple hackathons.
 Our Values:

Humility, transparency, integrity, and no-politics are in our core values.

We must think alternatively and against industry norms to be successful, so all crazy ideas are welcomed to be tested.

By the way, we leave our ego outside the door when searching for the best ideas.
